## User stories

As a user of this application, I want to be able to scan a reciept so that 
1. food descriptions are handed back in a list with quantity per item
2. this list is available in an easily parsed format for finding UPC codes with it or UPC codes are looked up or cached
3. these UPC codes can be sorted into food/non-food for macro-measurement of diet

### [Some notes about user stories from Atlassian:](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories)

Stories keep the focus on the user. A to-do list keeps the team focused on tasks that need to be checked off, but a collection of stories keeps the team focused on solving problems for real users.
 
Stories enable collaboration. With the end goal defined, the team can work together to decide how best to serve the user and meet that goal.
 
Stories drive creative solutions. Stories encourage the team to think critically and creatively about how to best solve for an end goal.
 
Stories create momentum. With each passing story, the development team enjoys a small challenge and a small win, driving momentum. 

[Basically,]

“As a \${persona}, I \${want_to}, \${so_that}.”
